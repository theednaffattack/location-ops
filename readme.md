## Location Ops

The web app that helps you scout locations and use it in whatever format you need back at the office.

Chock full of that 'metadata' you crave.

Make that movie pop with Location Ops

## ToDos

Make the sample data below specific to the new ops focused application with data from google maps, maybe other places as well.

## ...rest of the ToDos...

1) Add an image to the readme
2) Add the Travis CLI info the kids are using to this readme

### Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```
